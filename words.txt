Think you can beat a collection of beads at tic tac toe?

TURN
How can an inanimate object learn?
TURN
First we need to define 'learning.' In this case, the best way is
'changing behavior based on past experience.'
TURN
You're giving the machine experience now as you play against it.
TURN
But, what is it?
TURN
Your foe is a (simulated) collection of buckets full of beads.
TURN
Each turn, the machine picks up the bucket that represents the
position of the board and chooses a random bead.
Its color dictates its next move.
TURN
So, at first it is choosing at random.
(It might be a little dumb. Go easy on it.)
TURN
But, depending on the outcome of a game, it updates these buckets.
For each color bead used in the game, it will:

Add 3 in the case of a WIN
Remove 1 in the case of a LOSS
Add 1 in the case of a DRAW

to its respective bucket.
TURN
In theory, the beads populating the buckets will shift to the
optimal decision.
(Side note: The bead in the lead is whose
color you see below in each bucket. Gray is a tie.)
TURN
It discovers strategies, and in many cases can create new ones
humankind has never seen. (At least, for games far more complicated
than tic-tac-toe. Us humans have sorta got this one on lock.)
TURN
Just by playing against it, you're increasing its dataset and
making it smarter.
TURN
This is just one method of machine learning, a subgroup of
artificial intelligence that has overtaken our modern world.
TURN
Machine learning has achieved image recognition, voice-to-text,
Youtube video recommendations, and even self-driving cars.
TURN
Yet, when most people hear 'Artificial Intelligence,'
they imagine superintelligent androids taking over the world.
TURN
Never buckets of beads.
How sad, our poor little guy, overlooked.
TURN
Oops. Um...
TURN
I just referred to our inanimate pile of beads as a
'little guy'... didn't I?
But it's just a machine. Literally ones and zeros.
TURN
As human beings, we have a tendency to anthropomorphize things.
TURN
This is quickly becoming a problem.
As AI technology becomes more and more ubiquitous,
people can become too trusting of these machines.
TURN
Their false intelligence and reliance on numbers lulls people into
thinking of them as trustworthy, when really these machines
are beginning to hold more and more power.
TURN
Computers are good at some things, but not morality. If even we
can’t translate our sense of right and wrong into concrete rules
(see the entire study of metaethics),
how can a programmer code that for a computer?
TURN
They can’t. So, when these machines are unleashed into the world,
judging teachers, job resumes, images,
and every person who’s ever been online,
they have no bigger picture than the numbers they’re given.
TURN
This, as Cathy O’Neil points out in her book
Weapons of Math Destruction, can promote feedback loops
that increase the inequality in the world.
TURN
Even though people assume machine learning is completely unbiased
(being a computer - an inanimate object),
it really only knows what its programmers - humans - have taught it,
and the biases get put right back in, only overlooked.
TURN
Take, for example, Kyle Behm’s experience job searching,
with an AI-assessed personality test called the “Five Factor Model”
test. Even though he had a near-perfect SAT and had gotten into
Vanderbilt, it profiled him for his bipolar disorder that shouldn’t
be known of - much less taken into account - by employers.
TURN
And fifth-grade teacher Sarah Wysocki’s teaching evaluation done by
IMPACT, which got her fired due to her students’ test scores even
though she was praised by faculty and students for her skill.
TURN
Also all of the people funneled through diploma mills like University
of Phoenix or Corinthian College, who show their ads to low-income
people using AI-driven targeted marketing to rake in government
financed loans as tuition
and leave the poor dropping out with loads of debt.
TURN
Or the large population of people (around 50% of the US)
whose jobs are being threatened by AI automation.
TURN
All these injustices go overlooked because people assume
machine learning is innocuous.
TURN
Maybe you should be scared of piles of beads.
